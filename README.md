# Welcome to iChain

## Here is your guided getting started guide. 

1. Download [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) **Note** this will automatically download Ollama, you need to run the ollama setup before proceeding. This is a background app with no graphical user interface, it is CLI only
 
2. Open a terminal (Powershell, bash, or CMD shouldn't matter)
2.1 run ```ollama pull tinydolphin```
2.2 run ```ollama list```
2.3 run ```ollama run tinydolphin```

**With tinydolphin** loaded, you can say Hi or something to confirm it is running. 

3. Add this system prompt and press enter
``` Add the System prompt here```
4. Run ````/save iChain````
5. Good luck on your install odysessy! 

**A couple of hints** for the way... if you are a Master branch type (google it if you don't know) HRAria will not be very helpful, and the Architec likes it when people say thank you.
